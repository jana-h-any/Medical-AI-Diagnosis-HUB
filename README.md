# Medical-AI-Diagnosis-Application
A comprehensive AI-powered web application for medical diagnosis, built with Streamlit, featuring three advanced predictive models:
  - Stroke Risk Prediction
  - Liver Disease Stage Classification (3 stages)
  - Brain Tumor Detection (CT & MRI images)
    
The project integrates data preprocessing, EDA, model training with hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and deployment, making it a complete AI solution for healthcare analytics.
